# Destroy-The-Nexus
In Destroy the Nexus, you must be fast and quick by pressing the correct spells to destroy the nexus that has a life equal to the champion mastery points of your best champions (Top 10). The Spells will approach to their key, and the closer they are when you press the key the more damage you deal to the nexus, but if you miss, you'll receive damage.  You think you can reach the maximum level using your best champion?
